Inferred time series frequency: 'D'
Provided train_data has 2628 rows, 1 time series. Median time series length is 2628 (min=2628, max=2628). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'SARI'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MSE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
